1. By completing Workshop 1, I have learned how to create a new project and write simple code in Visual Studio 2019. I have also learned how to create new directories on matrix and transfer files from my PC to Seneca’s servers. Furthermore, I have learned the commands to compile, run, and submit my programs on the matrix.

2. SSH stands for Secured Socket Shell protocol. This protocol allows students to login and securely connect to Seneca’s matrix, and run commands remotely. The SSH client application I used is PuTTy, which allows me to run command lines to compile, run, and submit my .c code and this reflection. 

3. SFTP stands for secure file transfer protocol. This protocol allows students who have connected to Seneca’s matrix server to securely transfer files from their personal device to Seneca’s servers. In this workshop, I used the WinSCP application to remotely log in to matrix and upload the files required for this workshop. I did so by locating the files on my PC and dragging them over to my assigned directory on the server.
